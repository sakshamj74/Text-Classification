# Text-Classification
### This project is about doing Unsupervised text Classification. In this we will start from basic models like K - Means Clustering and move on to advanced techniques to make it better
### The ultimate aim is to make a web app where user can upload data and get a report having percentage distribution of different caategories in which data is categorised along with some sample queries. 
### For starting up I have added some data(News.csv) news headlines. We will start by classifying them into different categories like Business, Tech, Sports etc.
